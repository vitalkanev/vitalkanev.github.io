        <h1>Welcome to <i>VitalKanev's Web Experiments</i>!</h1>
        <p>This website, including the repository, <b>IS NOT</b> a personal
        website. I don't have time having one yet, so please check later.</p>
        <p>However, if you are a developer or understand some things from
        there, check out some stuff from here.</p>
        <!--<p>
            By the way I don't like using Bootstrap, Bulma (woah no! Confusion
            warning!) or any frameworks. I understand CSS 100% myself, so
            please DON'T ask me about frameworks!
        </p>-->
